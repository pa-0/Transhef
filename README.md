### Features
- Google Translate-like horizontal language selector
- Very quick translation and startup
- Multiple translation providers (soon!)
- Translation history
- Customizable for all your needs

### Installation
#### Prebuilt
- Go to the Releases tab and download both the `.msixbundle` nad `.cer` files.
- Make sure you have App Installer on your machine (Alternative methods of installation or "debloated" machines are not supported.)
- Open the `.cer` file, install in for either all users and choose "Trusted people" as the certificate store (manually!)
- Open and `.msixbundle` file with App Installer and click "Install"
- Done!
#### From source
- Open the repo in Visual Studio (in my case, 2022 Community)
    - make sure you have the UWP workload and Windows 11 10.0.22621.0 SDK installed.
- Click F5 or choose "Local Machine" in the options on top.
- Done!

### Contribution
Feel free to submit PRs to issues that haven't been solved and feature requests have been tagged as "planned". If you have a feature request, open an issue. I do not accept translations yet because the app is in a very early stage and it has not been modified to support different languages yet (ironic, isn't it?).
